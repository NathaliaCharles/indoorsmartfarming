# indoorsmartfarming

The objective of this project is to create a prototype that will help build a system that will allow people to implement smart farming in Mauritius. In order to do so, I will be testing the functions of an indoor plant detection system. This system will be able to identify if the plant is getting enough water and at the right temperature.
